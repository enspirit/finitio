# Finitio - A Data Language

*Finitio* is a data language. For now, it is limited to a data definition
language (DDL). Think "JSON/XML schema", but the correct way. *Finitio* comes
with a dedicated type system for defining data and a theory, called
*information contracts*, for interoperability with programming and data
exchange languages.
